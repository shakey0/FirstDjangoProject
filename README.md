## Why am I learning Django?

After successfully completing my last major solo project, I am now embarking on my next journey: mastering Django to prepare myself for the professional software development world. During my Django learning journey, I will also focus on refining other essential skills, including the use of JavaScript and Bootstrap as necessary. While I plan to follow tutorials on Udemy for initial guidance, I am committed to not just replicating the tutorial projects. At every opportunity, I will enhance the functionality of the applications shown in the tutorials, adding my own features whenever I deem it necessary. This approach will undoubtedly push me out of my comfort zone, compelling me to venture on my own and solve problems independentlyâ€”a critical capability for thriving in the professional sphere.

## This Project

This is a food web app using Python with Django, Bootstrap, and a tiny bit of JavaScript. My aim is to make this look and function like a real world web app that someone would use to manage a restaurant/takeaway or order food on.
